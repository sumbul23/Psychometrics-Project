## Abstract
The study explores the concept of Protestant Work Ethic (PWE) and its application in contemporary society, focusing on evaluating the fairness of PWE scale items across genders. The research examines the fairness of Protestant Work Ethic (PWE) scale items across genders using Differential Item Functioning (DIF) analysis. While most items show gender invariance, six items exhibit true mean differences between male and female respondents, potentially indicating adverse DIF. These findings suggest the need for periodic assessment and adjustment of old scales to ensure fairness in evaluating various metrics, including Protestant work ethic, across diverse gender groups. Additionally, further exploration is required to understand the factors contributing to Differential Item Functioning (DIF) and to enhance the long-term reliability of such scales.
